   -->Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and is used to help coordinate work among several people on a project while tracking progress over time. 
      In other words, it’s a tool that facilitates source code management in software development.
        Git favors both programmers and non-technical users by keeping track of their project files. It enables multiple users to work together and handles large projects efficiently

2. What do you understand by the term ‘Version Control System’?

SVN stored data in the form of files.

The master contains the latest stable release.

In SVN, the trunk directory has the latest stable release 

The contents of Git are hashed using the SHA-1 hash algorithm.

SVN doesn’t support hashed contents. 

7. Name a few Git commands with their function.
Git config - Configure the username and email address
Git add - Add one or more files to the staging area
Git diff - View the changes made to the file
Git init - Initialize an empty Git repository
Git commit - Commit changes to head but not to the remote repository

8. What are the advantages of using Git?
Faster release cycles
Easy team collaboration
Widespread acceptance 
Maintains the integrity of source code
Pull requests
git-7.

9. What language is used in Git?
Git is a fast and reliable version control system, and the language that makes this possible is ‘C.’ 


10. What is the correct syntax to add a message to a commit?
 git commit -m "x files created"

11. Which command is used to create an empty Git repository?
git init - This command helps to create an empty repository while working on a project. 

12. What does git pull origin master do?
The git pull origin master fetches all the changes from the master branch onto the origin and integrates them into the local branch.

git pull = git fetch + git merge origin/ master

Command - git fetch origin

git fetch --all

Command - git pull origin master

15. GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket are examples of git repository _______ function?
hosting. All the three are services for hosting Git repositories

16. What do you understand about the Git merge conflict?
A Git merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to resolve the differences in code between the two commits automatically.
